# Wind Turbine Sim
Java program simulating the physics of HAWT wind turbines using Blade Element Momentum theory. The purpose of this project was to determine the electrical efficiency in terms of power coefficient for a HAWT with given physical characteristics. The wind turbine is modeled using data from a NACA 2412 airfoil, but can easily be extended to accommodate various other types of airfoils. The project features a well documented API, which can be used to create library features.
